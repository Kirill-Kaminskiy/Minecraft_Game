        Introduction:
        -----------------
        	This graphics library was written to be exactly comptible with the chapters 
        in the book: 'Python for the Absolute Beginner'. The reformatted version of 
        livewires(http://tertial.livewires.org.uk/python/home) was incredibly simple 
        to use, powerful, and had many features. As the book became outdated copies of
        the library-the reformated version-became harder and harder to find. Trying to
        find a copy to teach some newcomers to python and failing, we decided
        to write our own library, compatible, to the dot, with the book's tutorials.
        Hopefully this will help a some people.
        	Since this is a reformatted version of livewires,we decided to call it 
        superwires. If you have a copy of the book, or any of its programs, you
        only have change the line: 'from livewires import game' to
        'from superwires import games' and it will work as intended. If you don't have
        the book and just want a good graphics library for python, read the tutorial
        ahead, or read the documentation at: https://pythonhosted.org/SuperWires/
        
        
        Tutorial
        ---------------
        
        Simple Program:
        ----------------
        from superwires import games
        
        games.init(screen_width=640, screen_height=480, fps=50)
        #makes screen with width, height, and frames per second
        
        games.screen.mainloop() # event loop
        
        That made a black window!!!
        
        Now add this line in the middle:
        games.screen.background=load_image('filename.png')
        
        That made a background!!!
        
        Now this:
        games.screen.add(Sprite(games.load_image('file.png'), x=320, y=240, dx=3, dy=3))#dx and dy stand for delta x and delta y
        
        That made a moving sprite!!!!
        
        Overriding Sprite:
        -----------------------
        
        First make a class:
        
        class Bouncy_Ball(games.sprite):
        	def __init__(self):
        		super(self, Bouncy_Ball).__init__(games.load_image('ball.png'), x=320, y=240, dx=3, dy=3)#normal super init
        
        	def update(self): #this is empty by default but is called every frame
        		if self.left<=0 or self.right>=640:#right and left edges to check if on edge
        			self.dx*=-1#reverse x velocity
        		
        		if self.top<=0 or self.bottom>=480:#top and bottom edges to check if on edge
        			self.dy*=-1#reverse y velocity
        
        Now instead of adding a sprite do:
        games.screen.add(Bouncy_Ball())
        
        That made a bouncing ball!!!!!
